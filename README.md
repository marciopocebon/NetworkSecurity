# Application overview
## Server (on RPI4B)
On the server side, we choose Nginx as HTTP Server and this is hosted on the RPI4B.Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
## Client (on VM)
For the client side, we used privoxy as a forward proxy client, which routes the traffic from the user to HTTP Server.Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks
